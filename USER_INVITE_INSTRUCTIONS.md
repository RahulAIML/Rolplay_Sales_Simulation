## Troubleshooting

### I'm not receiving coaching messages

**Common issues:**

1. **Did you invite BOTH bot accounts?**
   - Check your meeting invite and confirm both email addresses are listed
   - Missing even one will prevent the system from working

2. **Are you registered in the system?**
   - Go to the [Setup Page](https://rolplay-sales-simulation.onrender.com/setup)
   - Register with your Name, Outlook Email, and WhatsApp number
   - You should immediately receive a welcome message on WhatsApp

3. **Is your WhatsApp number correct?**
   - Make sure you included the country code (e.g., `+1234567890`)
   - The number must match exactly what you registered with

4. **Timing issues?**
   - The system checks for new meetings every 15 minutes
   - You may need to wait a few minutes after creating the meeting

### I received a message but it's not about my meeting

- Make sure you're the **meeting organizer** (the person who created the meeting invite)
- The system identifies you by your Outlook email address

### The bot email addresses bounced

- Double-check spelling:
  - `bhattacharyabuddhadeb147@gmail.com` (note the number 147)
  - `bhattacharyabuddhadeb@outlook.com` (note: no numbers)

## Pro Tips

### Save as Contacts
Add both bot email addresses to your contacts for easy access:
- Contact 1: "Sales Coach Bot (Gmail)"
- Contact 2: "Sales Coach Bot (Outlook)"

### Create a Template
If you create similar meetings often:
1. Create a meeting template in Outlook with both bots already invited
2. Use this template for new meetings

### Team Onboarding
When onboarding new team members:
1. Share this guide with them
2. Have them register at the setup page first
3. Walk them through inviting the bots to their first meeting

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
- Check the [Manager Setup Guide](./MANAGER_SETUP.md) for registration steps
- Review the [Bot Account Setup Guide](./BOT_ACCOUNT_SETUP.md) (admin only)

**Pro Tip**: The fastest way to verify everything is working is to create a test meeting with the bots and yourself as the only participants!
